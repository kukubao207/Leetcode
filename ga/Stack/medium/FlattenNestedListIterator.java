//341. Flatten Nested List Iterator
//Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.
//
//Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
//Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
//Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
//             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
//Example 2:
//
//Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
//Output: [1,4,6]
//Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
//             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
