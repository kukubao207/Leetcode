//894. All Possible Full Binary Trees
//A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
//
//Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.
//
//Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.
//
//You may return the final list of trees in any order.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: 7
//Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
//Explanation:
